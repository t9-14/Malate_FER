              <p>
                I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at 
                Naga College Foundation, Inc. My passion lies in technology and 
                software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a student, I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies. 
                I believe in the power of education and continuous learning to make 
                a positive impact in the world of technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me reading books, 
                playing strategic games, or exploring new technologies.
